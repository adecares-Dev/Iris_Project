## 🚀 How to Run

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/adecares-Dev/Iris_Project.git
   cd Iris_Project
````

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```

3. **Run the Jupyter Notebook**

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook notebooks/Iris_Analysis.ipynb
   ```

## 📊 Analysis & Visualizations

The notebook includes:

* **Line Chart** – Petal length trend across samples
* **Bar Chart** – Average petal length by species
* **Histogram** – Sepal width distribution
* **Scatter Plot** – Sepal length vs petal length (colored by species)

---

## 🛠 Dependencies

* pandas
* matplotlib
* seaborn
* scikit-learn

(Already listed in `requirements.txt` ✅)

---

## ✨ Notes

* The dataset was reduced to `iris_small.csv` to keep the repo lightweight and GitHub-friendly.
* To work with the **full Iris dataset**, you can directly load it using `sklearn.datasets.load_iris`.

👉 Would you like me to also include **example chart screenshots** inside the README (by saving plots as `.png` and linking them), so that anyone viewing your repo can see visuals without running the code?
